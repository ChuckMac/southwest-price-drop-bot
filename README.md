# southwest-price-drop-bot


This tool lets you monitor the price of Southwest flights that you've booked. It will text you if the price drops below what you originally paid. Then you can [re-book the same flight](http://dealswelike.boardingarea.com/2014/02/28/if-a-southwest-flight-goes-down-in-price/) and get Southwest credit for the price difference.

You can log in with either:

- The admin username/password combo, example: `admin` and `the-admin-password-123`
- A phone number/password combo, example: `13034449999` and `the-admin-password-123` (unformatted phone number WITH country code)

The second option is nice when giving out access to friends and family since it will only display alerts for the given phone number.  Note that the password is the same for all accounts.
